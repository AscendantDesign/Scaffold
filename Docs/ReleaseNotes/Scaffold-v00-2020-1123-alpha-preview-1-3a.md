-------------------------------------------------

### Background

This revision introduces certain features from the **Chatbot Interface**
sprint that were completed in the first part of November 2020, the major
focus of which was to bring the operational capabilities of the
application up to the level of being able to publish working
conversations to Slack.

In this version, there are still a few outstanding tasks that need to be
completed on the chatbot emulator.

### Bugs Fixed

No bugs were reported from the previous version.

### Feature Tasks Completed

The following tasks were completed during this portion of the **Chatbot
Interface** sprint.

-   **ADO1852 - Chatbot - Research SlackBot API**. Slack API allows
    external web servers to connect, receive events, and send incoming
    messages. All general logic is on the external server.

-   **ADO1902 - Documentation - Create Map Of Node Parts**. The page
    Anatomy of a Decision Node has been published on the GitHub site.
    This update closes git issue
    <https://github.com/AscendantDesign/Scaffold/issues/3>

-   **ADO1912 - Chatbot - ScaffoldSlackPack - Slackbot API Server**.
    Basic Slackbot server is now working in server project

    and run directly on Slack.
