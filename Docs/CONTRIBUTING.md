GIT-SCM.com has a good article about contributing to GitHub projects, in general, at [6.2 GitHub - Contributing to a Project](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/GitHub-Contributing-to-a-Project). It's recommend you read that. As a quick outline, the following general steps are typical.

 - Login to your own GitHub profile.
 - Visit the Scaffold repository.
 - In the upper right-hand corner of the page, click the Fork button to fork the project.
 - Create a new branch using the topic of your change.
 - Make changes and updates.
 - Commit the changes to your local branch
 - Have the changes in your branch peer-tested.
 - Open a Pull Request with the Scaffold team.
 - After any necessary discussion or changes, the branch will be merged or closed.
 - Refresh the new master back to your fork.
