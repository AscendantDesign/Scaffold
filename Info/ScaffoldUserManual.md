Philosophy
----------

The philosophy of this application is simple. If it's difficult to use
or confusing in any way, then the UI developers did something wrong and
will need to fix it. Sometimes that will take a couple of iterations to
get right and other times, everything will just work the way we thought
it would. Your interaction with us is important for determining our
level of success though.

In other words, we want you to be able to use this application by
following your own intuition.

There are bound to be certain procedures in the future that will come up
where following a checklist is the safest and most consistent way to
accomplish your goal, but for all practical intents and purposes,
anything that the application can do for you should be accessible in the
place or manner that you expect it would be.

With all of that aside, please remember that Scaffold is still just
infant software, and will be for some time.

Limitations
-----------

The Scaffold application is still in the earliest stages of development
so there are bound to be a number of limitations not documented here.
Your input is welcome about the limitations you have perceived.
